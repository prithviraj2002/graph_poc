# graph_poc

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a proof of concept project in flutter to build mixed interactive graphs.

Widgets directory contains multiple widgets, it has a bar graph, a line graph built using fl_chart, another line graph built using draw_chart and finally ordinalComboBarLineGraph, a widget that combines both the charts, line and bar.

Screens contain 2 screens, main_screen contains a stack to superimpose bar chart and line chart, but the x axis does not align as desired.
The home_screen contains a home page which displays the ordinalComboBarLineGraph, which is further called in main and displayed when run.
